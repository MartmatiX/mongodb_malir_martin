Project created for subject NoSQL on FIM UHK 2025. The project was well received and got 38/40 points. The only issue were the queries which were deemed to simple.

# Warning
The teacher does actually go through what you sent so use this as an ispiration, if you copy paste this work she might notice you stole it. I, on the other hand, do not care :)
